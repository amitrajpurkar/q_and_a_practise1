# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### SOLID Principles Compliance
- [ ] Single Responsibility: Each module has one reason to change
- [ ] Open/Closed: Classes open for extension, closed for modification
- [ ] Liskov Substitution: Child classes substitutable for parents
- [ ] Interface Segregation: No fat interfaces, clients depend only on used methods
- [ ] Dependency Inversion: High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules

### Test Coverage Requirements
- [ ] 90% minimum test coverage planned
- [ ] TDD approach ( test-first development)
- [ ] Unit tests for all business logic
- [ ] Integration tests for service interactions
- [ ] End-to-end tests for user journeys

### Modular Architecture Requirements
- [ ] Clear backend/frontend separation
- [ ] Service layer abstractions
- [ ] Independent module deployability
- [ ] No direct data access from presentation layer

### Programming Concepts Implementation
- [ ] Arrays and data structures
- [ ] User-defined objects and records
- [ ] Simple and complex selection ( if/else, nested if, switch)
- [ ] Loops and nested loops
- [ ] User-defined methods with parameters and return values
- [ ] Sorting algorithms
- [ ] Searching algorithms
- [ ] File I/O operations
- [ ] Sentinels/flags for control flow
- [ ] Recursion where appropriate
- [ ] Merging sorted data structures
- [ ] Polymorphism implementation
- [ ] Inheritance hierarchies
- [ ] Encapsulation practices
- [ ] Text file parsing capabilities

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
